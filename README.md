The GitHub Account I created is going to be used for my CTI.110.0005 Class at Waketech.

The repository I created will be used to pool any files for this class to be added into the folder I created for the remainder of this semester.

In order to clone the repository I needed to make a GitHub account online and create a repository first, then downloaded the GitHub desktop app and clone the repository there. Then I needed to create or select a folder in where I would like the clone to be accessed and saved. 
# About me  
## My interests:
There's a lot of things about me that make up who I am.  I find that I am an extroverted individual who like to go out with friends, explore, and am always open to new things.  Underneath is a list of some hobbies I have when I have some free time.
#### Hobbies:
* Gaming
* Fishing
* Listening to music
* Dancing (Spanish music mainly)

#### Favorite music:  
I am **very interested** in music, a lot of music I'd reccomend to anyone varies in opinion and genre but nonetheless, I am still here to share what I enjoy!
##### Artists/Bands 
* Pink Floyd is my #1 favorite, esepcially their album [**_The Wall_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r48BLz42NuI&ab_channel=PlayMusic)
* Queen is a close 2nd, and a favorite from them to listen to is their single [**_Bohemian Rhapsody_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ&ab_channel=QueenOfficial)
* Gorillaz is a classic just because they offer music almost everyone likes since their band is so diverse. One of favorite songs from them are [**_On Melancholy Hill_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04mfKJWDSzI&ab_channel=Gorillaz)
* Abba is a good _and different_ last reccomendation as they're an older group that originated in Sweden. One of their most known works is their movie musical [**_Mamma Mia_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unfzfe8f9NI&ab_channel=AbbaVEVO)
