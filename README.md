The GitHub Account I created is going to be used for my CTI.110.0005 Class at Waketech.

The repository I created will be used to pool any files for this class to be added into the folder I created for the remainder of this semester.

In order to clone the repository I needed to make a GitHub account online and create a repository first, then downloaded the GitHub desktop app and clone the repository there. Then I needed to create or select a folder in where I would like the clone to be accessed and saved.
